# K-Means-Clustering-From-Scratch
This is the python code for k means clustering algorithm without using any extra library built from scratch with all necessary calculations done. Visualization of Unclustered and Clustered Data have also been done with the use of different colors for better understanding.

K-Means clustering is a unsupervised machine learning algorithm which is mainly used for creating clusters/groups from unlabelled data.
